The magic of Prince
Prince is a computer program that converts XML and HTML into PDF. It is simple, yet very powerful, and it
creates beautiful documents. The purpose of this small document is to showcase the formatting magic Prince
can do. We have chosen to highlight eighteen of our favorite features. This document is written in HTML
and converted to PDF by Prince. The source file is a compact 13k document, including the embedded CSS,
SVG and MathML.

#1: Hyphenation
Prince 6 supports automatic hyphenation which can break
words across several lines, adding a hyphen at the word
break. Hyphenation is controlled with a set of experimen-
tal CSS properties, and hyphenation patterns for differ-
ent languages can be supplied. Notice how the text in this
document is hyphenated.
#2: Rounded borders
CSS3 introduces support for rounded borders. In the table
below, some of the corners have been rounded. On pur-
pose, the bottom right corner has an asymmetrical shape.

apple yes
yes
orange yes
no
#3: Character substitution
It’s sometimes convenient to replace one character with
another without changing the source document. For ex-
ample, the apostrophe character is easily found on key-
boards, but in print it’s common to replace it with a quota-
tion character. Notice how Prince 6 has replaced the apos-
trophes in this paragraph.
#4: HTTP support
Prince 6 has built-in HTTP support
and can fetch pages, images, DTDs
and style sheets from the web. The
image to the left was automatically
fetched when the PDF version was
generated.
#5: Web fonts
Prince 6 can fetch fonts from the web and use them with-
out installing them on your system. The fonts used in
the PDF version of this document are web fonts. We are
grateful to Ray Larabie, Dieter Steffmann, and Red Hat
for making hi-quality fonts freely available.
#6: Image resolution
Sometimes images should be scaled to a certain resolu-
tion, rather than to an absolute size. In Prince, you can set
the resolution of an image as a property in the style sheet.
The smiley face in the previous section was scaled this
way. The smiley also represents the challenging Acid2
test, which Prince 6 passes.
#7: Columns
Columns
are
commonly
used on paper and Prince
supports multi-column lay-
outs described in CSS. This
document is laid out in two
columns. Also, this section
uses a two-column layout
with gap and a rule be-
tween. The width of the gap
and the style of the rule is
set in the style sheet.
#8: CMYK colors
Printers don’t use RGB colors, they mostly use CMYK:
cyan, magenta, yellow and black. Prince 6 can read
CMYK colors and will use them, if present. The heading
above this paragraph has both an RGB color (red) and
a CMYK color (bluish). Therefore, the text is red in

browsers, but blue in the PDF version. This is for demon-
stration purposes; normally the colors would be close to
each other.
#9: Counters
If you are reading the HTML source code of this docu-
ment, look for the h2 elements. You will notice that they
contain the text of the headings, but not their number.
The list item number, including the “#” and “:” are au-
tomatically generated by the style sheet. Generated con-
tent and counters are especially useful for complex docu-
ments. They are described in CSS level 2.1.
#10: Crop and cross marks
In printing, crop marks are used to indicate where the
printed paper should be cut. Cross marks are used to align
prints of different colors to improve color reproduction.
Prince 6 adds support for crop and cross marks, and the
PDF version of this document includes both.
#11: Cross-references
Prince can read hyperlinks inside a document and gener-
ate page numbers accordingly. For example, it will auto-
matically find out which page Headers and Footers are
discussed on (page 2). Cross-references are used to gener-
ate the Table of contents (page 1).
#12: Math
Prince 6 add experimental support for MathML. Here is
an example:
x
maps to
→y = fn (x) = (1 + 1
xn)
n
#13: Footnotes
Footnotes1 are essential in printed documents and Prince
knows how to generate them. Unlike what some people
think, footnotes are not the place to put information you
don’t want to see. More often, footnotes will actually at-
tract attention. 9 of 10 of readers will read the footnotes
before they read the text from where the footnotes are an-
chored.2
#14: Leaders
Leaders consist of dots or dashes in a row leading the
eye across a page. For example, the Table of contents has
leaders in it. The leaders are not found in the document it-
self, but rather in the style sheet.
#15: SVG
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a lan-
guage for describing two-dimensional graph-
ics for the web. SVG images scale better than
traditional bitmapped images and are suitable
for printing. The crown is generated by two SVG ele-
ments.
#16: Page floats
On paged media, elements can be set float to the top or
bottom of pages. The big URL at the top of this page
comes after this paragraph in the source code, but is float-
ed to the top by the style sheet.
#17: Headers and footers
Printed documents often have page headers and footers.
For example, page numbers are often printed at the bot-
tom of the page, and the document title is shown at the top
– except on title pages.
#18: PDF Bookmarks
Prince will automatically generate PDF bookmarks from
heading elements in HTML. The feature is set with a
property in the style sheet, and can also be used with other
markup languages.
1. A footnote is a note placed at the bottom of a page of a book or manuscript that comments on or cites a reference for a designated
part of the text.
2. Often, the most interesting information is found in the footnotes.
